# GitFitApp
This is now titled the StayFit! app.

To run the code yourself you will need to have a compiler like VScode that enables you to install packages using the terminal.

You will need to install express, mysql, dotenv, nodemon, and cors before you try to get my app to work. Then, launch the backend using the command "demon app".

This will enable you to use the database functionalities to log food items in the web application. Also, before you run the app, make sure to store the client and server folders 
into a single "Project" folder that way my backend can communicate with the frontend without repercussions.
